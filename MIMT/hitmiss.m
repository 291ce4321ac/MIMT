function outpict = hitmiss(inpict,varargin)
%   OUTPICT=HITMISS(INPICT,SE1,{SE2})
%   Apply a hit or miss filter to an image.  
%
%   This is a passthrough to the IPT function bwhitmiss(), with internal fallback implementations 
%   to help remove the dependency of MIMT tools on the Image Processing Toolbox. As with other 
%   fallback tools, performance without IPT may be degraded due to the methods used.  
%
%   INPICT is an image of any standard image class. Multichannel and multiframe images are supported.
%      Proper inputs should be logical; numeric images will be thresholded at 50% gray.
%   SE1, SE2 are 2D structuring elements
%      While IPT tools support 3D structuring elements and their own strel class, the fallback 
%      methods do not.  If SE1/2 is a numeric array, it will be thresholded at 0.5.
%      Unless requirements are particular, a simple structuring element can be made in the 
%      absence of IPT by using existing MIMT tools (e.g. simnorm(fkgen('disk',10))>0.5)
%      As an alternative to the use of two strels, this function also supports the interval syntax
%      supported by bwhitmiss().
%
%  Output class is logical
