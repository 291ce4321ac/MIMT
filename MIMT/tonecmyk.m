%  Adjust image tone by adjusting CMYK components relative to the
%  CMYK and saturation distribution in an image.

%  This is based on Iain Fergusson's GMIC tools.

%
%  INPICT is an RGB of any standard image class.  
%  TC,TM,TY,TK are lookup tables used for PWL interpolation.
%    Each of these is a 4x3 matrix nominally in the range [-1 1], but are 
%    not constrained.  Each matrix represents the amount by which the 
%    corresponding component should be adjusted.  Consider the example TC:
%      % Adjust cyan for pixels which contain
%      Tc = [0 0 0;  % [little some much] cyan
%            0 0 0;  % [little some much] magenta
%            0 0 0;  % [little some much] yellow
%            0 0 0]; % [little some much] black
%  TSAT is a 1x5 vector specifying how the influence of the above transformation
%    should be scaled with respect to the HSV saturation of the source image.
%    Values should nominally be in the range of [0 1], but are not constrained.
%  RANGETYPE optionally specifies how the output is handled. (default 'preserve')
%    'preserve' adjusts the output to preserve luminosity.
%    'clampcmyk' truncates values to standard data range prior to conversion.
%    'clamprgb' truncates values to standard data range after conversion.
%    'normalizecmyk' scales values to standard data range prior to conversion.
%    'normalizergb' scales values to standard data range after conversion.
%  PRESETMODE is an optional key that is only needed if you want to replicate
%    the exact behavior of the GMIC tool.  When 'presetmode' is specified, 
%    an attempt will be made to replicate (what I assume is) a bug that causes 
%    the K adjustment to be unaffected by the application of Tsat.  This bug 
%    does not affect tonergb().
%
%  Output class is inherited from input
%
