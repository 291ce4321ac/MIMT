%   OUTPICT=ADAPTHISTEQFB(INPICT,{OPTIONS})
%   Adjust the contrast of an image using a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) 
%   technique, such that it has a specified intensity distribution.  Instead of adjusting the entire 
%   image based on global properties (like histeq would), perform the operation by subdividing the 
%   image into tiles and then interpolating between those local properties to transform the image.
%
%   This is a passthrough to the IPT function adapthisteq(), with an internal fallback implementation 
%   to help remove the dependency of MIMT tools on the Image Processing Toolbox. As with other fallback 
%   tools, performance without IPT may be degraded due to the methods used.  
%
%   INPICT is a single-channel image of any standard image class. 
%   OPTIONS includes the key-value pairs:
%     'numtiles' specifies the tiling that should be used (default [8 8]; minimum 2)
%         The more tiles are used, the better the function can respond to local properties.
%     'cliplimit' scales the contrast limiting behavior (default 0.01)
%         This is a scalar between [0 1].  Maximal contrast occurs at cliplimit=1.
%     'nbins' specifies the number of histogram bins (default 256)
%     'range' selects how the output image data should be scaled (default 'full')
%         'full' specifies that the output data should be scaled WRT the range implied by the output class.
%         'original' specifies that the output data should be scaled WRT the input image extrema.
%     'distribution' specifies the target output intensity distribution (default 'uniform')
%         Accepts 'uniform', 'rayleigh', or 'exponential'
%     'alpha' specifies the distribution parameter (default 0.4)
%         This is only useful when the selected distribution is either 'rayleigh' or 'exponential'.
%
%   See adapthisteq() documentation for more details.
%
%  Output image class is inherited from INPICT

% this is all strongly based on adapthisteq(); forgive the similarity.  there were a few things i'd have liked 
% to have done my own way but i'm limited by the desire to make the behavior replicate the IPT implementation 
% because of how this function is intended to be used both with and without IPT.  i honestly thought someone 
% would've had a CLAHE implementation on the FEX already, but the ones i found were either clumsy wrappers for 
% adapthisteq() or they were undocumented buggy garbage.  hey, at least i document my buggy garbage. :D

% for default settings on a 900x650 DPFP test image, this takes about twice as long as adapthisteq() does, 
% with an RMS pixel difference of ~8E-17.  i caused some slight class-dependent differences due to when i normalized 
% and how i did the interpolation, but this is way more than close enough.  the peak memory usage is probably higher
% than adapthisteq(), since i normalize early and explicitly allocate the tile components during interpolation.
