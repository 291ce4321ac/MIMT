function outpict = imrotateFB(inpict,angle,varargin)
%   OUTPICT=IMROTATEFB(INPICT,ANGLE,{METHOD},{BOUNDARY})
%   Rotate an image array.
%
%   This is a passthrough to the IPT function imrotate(), with an internal 
%   fallback implementation to help remove the dependency of MIMT tools on the 
%   Image Processing Toolbox. As with other fallback tools, performance without 
%   IPT may be degraded or otherwise slightly different due to the methods used.
%
%   INPICT is an image array of any standard image class; 4D arrays are supported.
%   ANGLE specifies the rotation angle in degrees
%   METHOD specifies the type of interpolation (default 'bicubic')
%      'nearest' performs nearest-neighbor interpolation
%      'bilinear' performs bilinear interpolation
%      'bicubic' performs bicubic interpolation
%   BOUNDARY specifies how the output image geometry should be handled (default 'loose')
%      'loose' supplies the image geometry required to render the entire rotated image
%          this is typically larger than the original image geometry
%      'crop' supplies only the central content that lies within the original geometry
%          this typically results in image content being cropped
%   
%   Where no image data exists, the output image will be zero-padded.
%
%  Output class is inherited from INPICT
