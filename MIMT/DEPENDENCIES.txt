The following files require Image Processing Toolbox to work

COMPLETE IPT DEPENDENCY:
vectorscan		(uses fspecial) (this usage is preserved for reference)
imcropzoom		(uses imcrop(), imcropRect(), and imshow())

PARTIAL IPT DEPENDENCY:
immask 			(geometric selection tools only)
uwredcomp		(only when using smoothing option (requires R2014a+))

NO IPT DEPENDENCY:
(everything else)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Many files have had their IPT dependency effectively removed by using tools such as  
those listed below.  

These tools include conditional fallback implementations which will run in the absence 
of IPT or in versions prior to the introduction of the corresponding IPT tools. 
Consider them if you want to reduce IPT dependencies in your own releases.
These are not generally drop-in replacements for all use-cases, and the fallback code 
may be slower than the IPT passthrough. Check the documentation and take note of any 
differences in supported functionality or syntax.  

adapthisteqFB	uses/replaces adapthisteq
bwareafiltFB	uses/replaces bwareafilt
bwdistFB		uses/replaces bwdist
bwlabelFB		uses/replaces bwlabel
despeckle		uses/replaces bwareaopen (default does both opening and closing)
histeqFB		uses/replaces histeq
hitmiss			uses/replaces bwhitmiss
imadjustFB		uses/replaces imadjust
imcast 			uses/replaces im2double, im2uint8, etc
imappmat		uses/replaces imapplymatrix (default output class handling differs)
imcropFB		uses/replaces imcrop
imfilterFB		uses/replaces imfilter (default edge handling differs)
imresizeFB		uses/replaces imresize
imrotateFB		uses/replaces imrotate
imhistmatchFB	uses/replaces imhistmatch
imnoiseFB		uses/replaces imnoise
imsharpenFB		uses/replaces imsharpen
imshow2			uses/replaces imshow (defaults, view controls, and capabilities differ significantly)
morphnhood		uses/replaces bwmorph, bwperim, (bwlookup to some extent)
morphops		uses/replaces imdilate, imopen, imtophat, etc
nhfilter		uses/replaces medfilt2, stdfilt, rangefilt, modefilt, (nlfilter/ordfilt2 to some extent)
padarrayFB		uses/replaces padarray
stretchlimFB	uses/replaces stretchlim

Other tools don't passthrough to their IPT counterparts, but may fill the same role 
depending on your needs. For example:

imhistFB		see imhist (fully supercedes IPT imhist; longer does IPT passthrough)
cshist			see imhist
simnorm			see mat2gray
edgemap			see imgradient, edge
replacepixels	see imoverlay
uniquant		see gray2ind
fkgen			see fspecial
tonemap			see tonemap
mono			see rgb2gray, im2gray, rgb2lightness
imerror			see immse, psnr
imcheckerboard	see checkerboard
pickblobs		see bwselect
splitchans		see imsplit
iminv			see imcomplement
imclassrange	see getrangefromclass
colordiff		see deltaE, imcolordiff
roifilter		see roifilt2
flattenbg		see imflatfield
unsharp			see imsharpen
immodify		see imcontrast
imcompare		see imfuse, imshowpair
rgb2linear		see rgb2lin
linear2rgb		see lin2rgb
and other color space conversion tools

Bear in mind that this passthrough-fallback approach to resolving IPT availability has complications.
Currently, MIMT is being slowly changed to support a broader set of numeric classes for image data,
but many IPT/MATLAB tools will not correctly handle things which are otherwise supported during fallback.

In other words, when a function synopsis says "$ARGUMENT is an array of any standard image class",
the set of supported classes may depend on whether you have IPT, and violating what's expected
may result in an error, or it may just silently give you a garbage result.  
Hopefully those inconsistencies will be fixed in time, but they're subtle and numerous.
Further concerns exist for uint64/int64 images.  See the imcast() synopsis for more info.

Some files may still require other resources:

wpread/wpwrite require the cwebp and dwebp utilities from Google
picdynamics requires LTI simulation tools which may be found in various toolboxes
gifread/gifwrite requires imagemagick for certain options
imrectify needs R2013b or newer in order to use the table class (only when using 'showgui',false)

While not dependent, various MIMT tools have used or have borrowed from various resources
and prior implementations.  These credits are typically mentioned in the function synopsis
or in internal comments.
